# The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure

This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for LLVM,
a toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers,
optimizers, and runtime environments.

We plan to modify clang to support user-defined type annotations for
use in the GAPS CLOSURE project. We will periodically merge the upstream
master repository.
